##Objective
 To create a wiki using the following:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Express
- SQL/Sqlite
- Agile development

##Minimum Viable Product
A basic implementation of this app should probably include:

- All articles should be editable.
- All articles should display an author.
- If an article is changed, the time of that change should be shown.
- Articles must be written in markdown so that the content is visually appealing
- User must receive an email when an article that they've published is edited.
- Users ust be able to add a category to an article so that articles can be organized.
- All users must be able to interact with the wiki, so it must be responsive.
